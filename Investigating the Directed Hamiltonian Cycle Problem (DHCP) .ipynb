    "# Investigating the Directed Hamiltonian Cycle Problem (DHCP)\n",
    "Olivia Qader\n",
    "\n",
    "Avaliable on GitHub: https://github.coventry.ac.uk/380CT-1718JANMAY/380CT-Hamiltonian-Cycle \n",
    "\n",
    "## Notation\n",
    "The notation will be set for this investigation by the use of $x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n$ as graph vertices with $G$ representing the graph so when fulfilling the right conditions this should display that\n",
    " $$  G = x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_1,\n",
    " $$ where $x_1$ is the starting and ending vertex of the graph. Each vertex that is not $x_1$ should be visited only once.\n",
    " \n",
    "The degree of $x_n$ will be shown as $d_n$ and Directed Paths will be set as $P_1, \\ldots , P_n$ with length equal to $2d_1, \\ldots, 2d_n.$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition of the Problem\n",
    "The problem which I will be investigating in this study is the Directed Hamiltonian Cycle Problem which refers to the context of a directed graph and the reqirements that it must be decided if the path visits every vertex exactly once and terminates at the same vertex at which it started. If it does not satisfy both conditions, it cannot be classed as a Hamiltonian Cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "DHCP is an NP-Complete problem as it can be verified in polynomial time and fulfills the conditions to be both NP and NP-Hard, making it NP-Complete. It was among the first problems to be found NP-complete as the decision version of HCP (Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems 1972) and has many applications which cause the study of the problem to continue today.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing Methodology\n",
    "**Exhaustive Search** : Goes through all possible results in a determined order. Average time for instances increases with $n$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Greedy Algorithm** : Goes through the highest values until it has completed. Average time for instances is $O$($n$ $log$ $n$)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meta-Heuristics** : As for Meta-Heuristic algorithms, a genetic algorithm has been chosen. This is a type of algorithm which evolves to the best solution through the crossover and mutation operation. (Schmitt, L. J., & Amini, M. M. 1998)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Special Cases** : Refers to instances which can be solved exactly in polynomial time. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Code\n",
    "During the code process, it was worked upon as a group between myself, Chris Mander and Samathy Barratt. We have worked to complete code together over a period of time including organised group code session meetings and using a shared GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Base \n",
    "The basis of each algorithm is based upon code which generates an adjacency matrix that will be tested through each approach to determine if it fits the requirements of the Hamiltonian Cycle. \n"

    "1. Run time grows greatly as vertex count increases.\n",
    "2. Due to the expensive run time as the vertex count increases, this algorithm is more suited towards smaller graphs. \n",
    "3. Exceptance ratio can be seen to peak at a vertex count of 10 and 50, although it is likely that 50 is an exception instead of a rule as exceptance is more likely at a lower vertex count statistically."
